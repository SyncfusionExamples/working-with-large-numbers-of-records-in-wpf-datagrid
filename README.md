# WPF DataGrid Virtual Loading
Example shows the built-in data virtualization support in WPF DataGrid where it processes the record creations in on-demand for better loading performance. 

In this way, datagrid provides the same loading time for 1K records and 1 million record. You can enable data virtualization in datagrid by setting [EnableDataVirtualization](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/cref_files/wpf/Syncfusion.SfGrid.WPF~Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Grid.SfDataGrid~EnableDataVirtualization.html) property.
